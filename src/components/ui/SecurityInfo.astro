    Security Analysis: How This Message System Works
  </h3>
  
  <div class="space-y-3 text-sm">
    <p>
      <span class="font-semibold text-green-600">Protected by HTTPS:</span> 
      Your messages are encrypted between your browser and this website using HTTPS, preventing network-level eavesdropping.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="font-semibold text-amber-600">Vulnerable at Processing:</span>
      Once received by the website, messages are sent to n8n automation service over HTTPS (encrypted in transit) but are accessible in unencrypted form within the n8n service itself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="font-semibold text-amber-600">Third-Party Transmission:</span>
      After processing, messages are sent to Telegram through their API. Both n8n and Telegram servers can technically access the message content.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">Data Storage:</span>
      Command history and message interactions are saved in your browser's local storage for convenience. 
      You can view this data with the <code>/age</code> command, disable storage with <code>/nosave</code>, or clear everything with <code>/clearstorage</code>.
      No message content is stored on the server.

    <h4 class="font-semibold text-sm mb-2 text-primary">Cryptographic Perspective</h4>
    <p class="text-sm">
      This system illustrates a common security pattern: messages protected in transit but vulnerable at processing points. 
      True end to end encryption would encrypt the message on your device in a way that only the recipient could decrypt it, 
      preventing intermediaries from reading content.

      My research focuses on analyzing and designing the fundamental building blocks of these cryptographic protocols. This includes 
      block ciphers, hash functions, and cryptographic primitives that form the foundation of secure communications systems.

      <span class="font-bold">Educational Note:</span> This terminal example illustrates the importance of cryptography. 
      Even when cryptography is employed (e.g., through secure HTTPS connections), message content is exposed at each processing point. 
      Thus, beyond using cryptography, the correct design and implementation of cryptographic primitives and protocols are essential to preserve confidentiality and integrity.
