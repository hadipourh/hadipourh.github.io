# Welcome to My Academic Blog

This is my first blog post on this academic website. I'll be sharing insights about my research in cryptanalysis of symmetric-key primitives, side-channel attacks, and broader topics in information security.

## What to Expect

In future posts, I'll cover:

- Latest developments in cryptanalysis techniques
- Practical implementations of cryptographic algorithms
- Conference experiences and research findings
- Teaching materials and educational resources

## Research Focus

My current research at Ruhr University Bochum focuses on:

1. **Cryptanalysis of Symmetric-Key Primitives** - Developing new techniques for analyzing block ciphers and hash functions
2. **Side-Channel Attacks** - Investigating hardware security vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations
3. **Information Security** - Bridging the gap between theoretical cryptography and practical security

Stay tuned for more detailed posts about these topics!
