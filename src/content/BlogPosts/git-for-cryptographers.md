## Why Version Control Matters

In cryptographic research, we work with complex implementations, evolving papers, and collaborative projects across institutions. Without proper version control, we risk losing work, struggling with collaboration, and difficulty reproducing results.

### A Practical Example

A cryptocurrency project in 2019 lost significant work when implementation files were accidentally overwritten. Proper version control practices could have prevented this issue entirely.

## Git Fundamentals

### Installation and Setup

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install git

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git

# Check installation
git --version
```

### Setting Up Git (Do This Once)

```bash
# Set your identity (this will appear in all your commits)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@university.edu"

# Recommended settings for crypto research
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # Use VS Code as editor
git config --global pull.rebase true  # We'll explain this later
```

### Creating Your First Repository

```bash
# Start a new project
mkdir my-crypto-project
cd my-crypto-project
git init

# This creates a hidden .git folder that tracks everything
```

### Essential Commands

The basic Git workflow involves these core operations:

```bash
# 1. Create or edit files
echo "# My Crypto Project" > README.md
echo "print('Hello, cryptography!')" > hello.py

# 2. Check what Git sees
git status

# 3. Add files to staging area (prepare them for commit)
git add README.md hello.py
# or add everything: git add .

# 4. Commit (save a snapshot)
git commit -m "Initial commit with README and hello script"

# 5. Connect to remote repository (like GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-crypto-project.git

# 6. Push to remote (share with the world)
git push -u origin main
```

### Daily Operations

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# See detailed changes
git diff

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# Update from remote
git pull

# Push your changes
git push
```

## Security Considerations

When working with cryptographic research, security practices are paramount.

### Notable Security Incidents

**Case 1: Private Key Exposure (2021)**
A DeFi project inadvertently committed private keys to a public repository. The exposure resulted in significant financial losses within hours.

**Case 2: Research Infrastructure Breach (2020)**  
A university laboratory accidentally committed server credentials. This led to unauthorized access to computational resources and data.

### Protecting Sensitive Data

```bash
# Create a .gitignore file
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Security - Never commit these
*.pem
*.key
private_keys/
secrets.conf
.env

# Research data
test_data/
benchmark_results/
*.log
*.dat

# Temporary files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store

# LaTeX compilation
*.aux
*.bbl
*.blg
*.synctex.gz
EOF

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add gitignore for security"
```

### Recovery Procedures

If sensitive data has been committed:

```bash
# Remove from history (use with caution)
git filter-repo --path secret_file.key --invert-paths

# Force push (coordinate with collaborators)  
git push --force-with-lease

# Immediately revoke/change compromised credentials
```

## Collaboration Workflows

## Collaboration Workflows

### Basic Repository Operations

```bash
# Clone existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/crypto-project.git

# See all branches
git branch -a

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b my-improvement

# Push changes
git push origin my-improvement
```

### Contribution Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fork repository (via GitHub web interface)
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-project.git

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature"

# 4. Keep fork updated
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/crypto-project.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Understanding Git Messages

```bash
# "fatal: not a git repository"
# Solution: cd to project directory or run git init

# "Your branch is ahead by 3 commits"  
# Solution: git push

# "Changes not staged for commit"
# Solution: git add <files>

# "Merge conflict in filename"
# Solution: Edit file, remove conflict markers, git add, git commit
```

### Merge Conflicts in Research

When collaborating on papers or code, conflicts occur when multiple people edit the same lines.

```bash
# Check conflicted files
git status

# Edit files to resolve conflicts (remove <<<, ===, >>> markers)
# Add resolved files
git add conflicted_file.tex
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in Section 4"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Branch Management for Research

```bash
# Feature branch for experiments
git checkout -b experiment/new-attack

# Paper submission branch  
git checkout -b paper/crypto2024-submission

# Collaboration branch
git checkout -b collab/university-partner
```

### Repository Organization

```
crypto-project/
├── src/           # Implementation code
├── tests/         # Experimental scripts  
├── papers/        # LaTeX sources
├── data/          # Small datasets
├── docs/          # Documentation
└── .gitignore     # Security patterns
```

### Reproducible Research Tags

```bash
# Tag important milestones
git tag -a v1.0-submission -m "Code for CRYPTO 2024 submission"
git push origin --tags

# Later reproduce results
git checkout v1.0-submission
```

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Starting
git init                    # Initialize repository
git clone <url>            # Copy existing repository

# Daily workflow
git status                 # Check changes  
git add <files>           # Stage changes
git commit -m "message"   # Save snapshot
git push                  # Upload changes
git pull                  # Download updates

# Branching
git checkout -b <branch>  # Create new branch
git merge <branch>        # Combine branches

# Emergency
git reset --soft HEAD~1   # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reflog               # Find lost commits
```
